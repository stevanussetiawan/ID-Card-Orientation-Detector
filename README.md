# ID-Card-Orientation-Detector
## Description
Powerful tool designed to automatically detect the orientation angle of ID cards. This project utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately determine the orientation of ID cards in four possible angles: 0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째. The solution is ideal for applications requiring automated ID card processing, such as document verification systems, digital onboarding platforms, and automated check-in kiosks.
